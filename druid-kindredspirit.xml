			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can summon the spirit bound to your soul. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon your kindred spirit to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you that you can see, instead of assuming a beast form. It takes the form of an animal of your choice that you are familiar with, scaled up or down to be Small or Medium in size (your choice) and uses the accompanying Kindred Spirit stat block. The limitations are the same as Wild Shape for creatures with swimming or flying speed, unlocking at level 4 and 8 respectively.</p>
            <p class="indent">As its physical form draws upon the druid, its stat block scales with the druid’s ability scores.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Kindred Spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It acts independently to the best of its capabilities if you do not give it clear orders. If the Kindred Spirit is reduced to 0 hit points, its ties to you are forcibly severed as it disappears, and you take a number of d4s of force damage equal to your level. The spirit manifests until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you dismiss it using an action, or until you die.</p>
            <p class="indent">As an action, when you already have a summoned Kindred Spirit, you can resummon it and change its form if you so choose by expending one use of your Wild Shape feature. The new spirit appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you that you can see, and the old spirit disappears.</p>
