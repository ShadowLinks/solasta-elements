			<p>The Mischief Domain is associated with Misaye, who smiles upon all those who stand in defiance of the rules, and is naturally beloved by gamblers, swindlers, rogues and other unruly types. One does not only pray to Misaye for luck, but also for change and freedom, and to be liberated from all obligations in order to pursue one’s dreams.</p>

When you fail an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, and you don’t have disadvantage on that roll, you can use your reaction to reroll the d20. You must use the new roll, even if you had advantage.</p>

For each time you use Borrowed Luck beyond the limit, the DM can give you disadvantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw until you finish a long rest.</p>
