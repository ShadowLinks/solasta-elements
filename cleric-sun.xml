			<p>The Sun Domain is associated with Arun, the Tirmarian god of nature and the elements. It developed from ancient farmers’ worship of the sun and its life-giving power. Clerics who choose this domain use the power of sunlight to heal the faithful and smite the unworthy, ensuring respect for Arun and for nature in general.</p>

As an action, you start shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or die. Any creature that moves within 10’ of you or starts their turn there either takes half your cleric level in fire or radiant damage (your choice) if they are hostile, or gains half your cleric level in temporary hit points if they are friendly.</p>
