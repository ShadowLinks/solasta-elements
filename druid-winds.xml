			<p>As the Cataclysm raged and disastrously disrupted all magic on Solasta, some among the druids took it upon themselves to restore the world’s flow of mana by reshaping the prevailing winds. These Druids formed the first Circle of Wind. Millenia later, Circle of Wind Druids still travel the world, often in extremely hostile regions, doing whatever they can to heal the land.</p>

			<p>Being part of the Circle of Winds grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Winds Spells table.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>
