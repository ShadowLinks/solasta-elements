		<description>
			<p>This tradition is one of the most ancient on Solasta, dating back to the armies of the Manacalon Empire. Shock Arcanists are elite battle-mages, specializing in offensive and destructive magic. Most of their training focuses on making these spells more powerful, which is the origin of the “Arcane Shock.” Experts in this tradition can overload their spells with mana, making them more destructive. However, losing control of the excess mana risks a dangerous magical backlash.</p>
			<p class="indent">Legend has it that the greatest shock arcanists of the Manacalon Empire could also cast spells as a group, utilizing a magical resonance that greatly amplified a spell’s power. However, this art seems to have been lost since the Cataclysm.</p>
