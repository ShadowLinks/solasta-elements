			<p>Heirs to the high elf archery traditions of the old Empire, marksmen are undisputed masters of their art. Amongst the deadliest combatants on Solasta, their specialized training allows them to accurately target their enemies in almost any situation, including close-quarters combat. They are also taught to fletch arrows in all environments, ensuring they are also effective deep behind enemy lines.</p>
