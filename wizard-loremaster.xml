		<description>
			<p>This tradition was built over centuries of continuing efforts to salvage the lost magical knowledge of the Manacalon Empire. Loremasters are highly skilled at finding and learning new magic, and in their insatiable quest continuously train their memory to retain ever more spells. It has been said that knowledge is power, and Loremasters are masters of knowledge.</p>
