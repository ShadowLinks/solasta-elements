			<p>In a society where magic is prevalent, it is only natural to have spellcasters in the role of bodyguards. Originally an order of the Manacalon Empire, court mages are wizards who specialize in protecting their clients with steel and magic. Having a court mage at your side is seen as a symbol of prestige as only the wealthy, or those considered irreplaceable, are ever granted one.</p>

If you already have this Fighting Style from another class, you may replace the option from that class with a different one available to the class.</p>

			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use an action to create a powerful spell shield around yourself and a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you.</p>
			<p class="indent">A spell shield has a hit point maximum equal to three times your wizard level. Whenever a creature under the effect of Spell Shield takes damage, the shield takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the shield to 0 hit points, it disappears and the creature takes any remaining damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spell shield also disappears after 10 minutes, when you use this feature again, or if a shielded creature becomes separated by more than 30 feet from you. At level 14, the range of the spell shield increases to 60 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>

			<p>Starting at 14th level, when a Spell Shield is reduced to 0 hit points, it shatters in a bright flash. Hostile creatures within 15 feet of it must succeed a Constitution saving throw or become blinded, deafened, and silenced (incapable of casting spells that include a verbal component) until the end of their next turn. Additionally, the remaining strands of magic create a last layer of protection on its former target, granting them resistance to all damage types until the start of their next turn.</p>
