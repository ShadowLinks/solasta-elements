			<p>Used to wandering the desolate Badlands, shadow tamers know the lore and languages of darkness, traps, and the underground world. They walk without fear where others would hesitate to tread. Simply put, a shadow tamer is at ease where others are not. The countless hazards of the Badlands include darkness, monsters, rough terrain, bad weather, and chaos. Shadow tamers take all these dangers in their stride. Heights, depths, darkness, monsters: none of these bother them. In fact, they make them deadlier. In a monster’s den, they are the greater monster.</p>
