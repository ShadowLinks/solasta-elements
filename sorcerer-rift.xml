			<p>The prolonged instabilities caused by the existence of the Rift connecting Tirmar and Solasta has given birth to many new magic wielders across Solasta. These sorcerers are colloquially known as the children of the rift. Many are haunted by strange visions from worlds they have never known and the ability to cast spells they should not be able to access.</p>

			<p>Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Child of the Rift Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesnâ€™t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be from the sorcerer or cleric spell list, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.</p>
