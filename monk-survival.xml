			<p>Monks following the Way of Survival are often described as gentle monsters. Their intimidating bodies are often latticed with brutal training scars, but they are known for their peaceful and humble demeanors. Even when threatened physically, Survival Monks rarely retaliate, instead waiting for their attackers to tire and give up of their own accord.</p>
