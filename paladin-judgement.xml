			<p>Paladins who swear the Oath of Judgment believe that no sin can be overlooked, no matter how small, and that the punishment must fit the crime. Incorruptible and fervent in their quest, they are relentless in their pursuit of justice.</p>
			<p class="indent"></p>
			<h5 class="caption">TENANTS OF JUDGEMENT</h5>
            <p>Though the exact words and strictures of the oath of Judgment vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Judgment has no friends.</i></b>
                It doesn’t matter whether you are a prince or a beggar, judgment awaits you.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Judgment is merciful. </i></b>
                Delivering judgment is no small task; you must consider the circumstances as well as the sin.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Judgment is final.</i></b>
                The only valid appeal lies with the gods, in the afterlife. A ruling of a judgment paladin can’t be contested.
            </p>
