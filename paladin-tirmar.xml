		<description>
			<p>These paladins belong to an old order that is descended from the Tirmarian Inquisition. They are devoted to the destruction of their ancient enemies, the legendary shape-shifting Sorr-Akkath. Their tenets retain the pain inflicted by their ancestors and integrate the need to avoid being deceived and fighting the wrong enemies. They conduct their rituals in the old language of Tirmar and bear symbols of the old Inquisition. Since many believe that the Sorr-Akkath are either fictitious boogeymen or became extinct long ago, paladins of this oath are sometimes regarded as dangerously obsessed.</p>

            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Truth must prevail. </i></b>
                Evil roots itself in lies and deception. Truth is the key to the triumph of good.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Bring light to the darkness. </i></b>
                Light is the weapon of truth against the secrets and lies of darkness. Bring the light and you will vanquish evil.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Do not let evil blind you. </i></b>
                Let not your zeal bring suffering to the innocent. Evil will try to trick you into doing so.
