			<p>After the Cataclysm, most spellcasters died or completely lost the ability to use magic. However, as the years passed, rare children were born with the natural ability to draw mana to them from the surrounding environment and then manipulate it. Referred to as Mana Painters, they were highly regarded in the first centuries following the Cataclysm as they could still actively use magic, and were thus a source of much hope.</p>

			<p>Starting at 14th level, when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell, you can use your reaction to leech its magic. The targets of the spell have advantage on their saving throws against it, and its damage is halved if it deals any damage. The first time you use this power after each long rest, you also regain a number of sorcery points equal to the level of the spell leeched. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.</p>
