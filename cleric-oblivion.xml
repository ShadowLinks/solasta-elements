			<p>The Oblivion Domain is associated with Maraike, the goddess of life and death, in her darker aspect as mistress of death and dying. Clerics who choose this domain are usually members of the Order of Oblivion, and not as welcome as their counterparts of the Order of Life Regnant. Still, they walk the world doing their duty as servants of their grim goddess.</p>
