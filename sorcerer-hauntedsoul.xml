			<p>Like all Solastan sorcerers, the so-called “haunted souls” are the result of the Cataclysm. The unprecedented death resulting from that terrible event caused some with a deep magical affinity to be permanently haunted by spirits. Most simply went mad and few survived for long. However, a small number learned to live with and control the spirits, leading to an entirely new form of magic.</p>
