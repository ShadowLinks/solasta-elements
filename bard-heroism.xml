			<p>With their deep repertoire of songs and seemingly endless tales of heroic deeds, Heroism Bards are often seen as nothing short of heroes themselves. Their inspiring performances can embolden even the most timid heart against fear and doubt, and their indomitable spirit is an inspiration for all. No matter how grim a situation may be, Heroism Bards stand ready with an appropriate song to hand, leading others to ever greater feats, just like the heroes of old.</p>

			<p>Starting at 6th level, the inspiration you draw from the many heroic stories and songs you know allows you to push through, even in the most difficult times.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you have no Bardic Inspiration left you can still give Bardic Inspiration. When you do so, you roll a Bardic Inspiration die and take psychic damage equal to twice the number rolled. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way.</p>
