            <p>Unlike their inward-looking marsh halfling cousins, island halflings are driven by curiosity and a love of adventure. They are unmatched as sailors and shipwrights. Their vessels carry much of the trade that flows across the continent. Island halflings live for the smell of the sea, the breeze in their hair, and the rolling of a good ship underfoot.</p>
            <p class="indent">Island halflings are a little taller and sturdier than marsh halflings. Males tend to be portly, females curvaceous. Their faces are broader and rounder than human faces, with large eyes that are generally full of merriment. Halflings frequently bind their hair up in a braid or ponytail or cover it with a hat or a kerchief.</p>
