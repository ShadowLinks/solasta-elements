			<p>The Elemental Domain is associated with Arun, the god of nature. The prime god of the elements and the ancient head of the Tirmarian pantheon, Arun was the first deity to whom humans prayed when they were struggling to survive amid a hostile natural world. Now, on Solasta, Arun’s followers are mostly found in rural communities and barbarian tribes. Nevertheless, the powers granted by this ancient god are impressive.</p>
			<p class="indent">Clerics who choose the elemental domain can harness the primal forces of nature to their will, causing terrifying destruction and shrugging off attacks that use those forces.</p>

After a failed save, a target is also restrained until the beginning of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Call upon Thunder.</strong> As an action, you teleport up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. A thunderclap rings out, and any creature within 5 feet of you after you teleport must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 + your cleric level thunder damage on a failed save, or half as a much on a successful one. After a failed save, a target is also deafened until the beginning of your next turn.</p>
