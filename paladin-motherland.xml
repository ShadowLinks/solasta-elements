			<p>Trained by the oldest communities of Solasta, these paladins dedicate their lives to restoring the pre-apocalyptic world, saving the land from its decay, and bringing life back where it belongs, despite its violent and volcanic nature. They reject the term “Badlands” and instead call it the “Motherland.”</p>

			<h5 class="caption">TENANTS OF THE MOTHERLAND</h5>
            <p>Though the exact words and strictures of the oath of the Motherland vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>The Motherland belongs to the people. </i></b>
                Whatever monsters and thieves have taken from the rightful inhabitants of the Motherland, all these things must be returned to them.
            </p>
