			<p>Among survivors of the Cataclysm, some felt that magic was to blame. Of the many groups that arose from that turbulent era, few are as feared as Magebane Barbarians. Fiercely independent, they have a profound hatred for magic-users, whom they blame for almost destroying the world. For Magebane Barbarians, physical prowess is the only way of life.</p>

			<p>Starting at 3rd level, while raging, when you see a hostile creature within 30 feet of you casting a spell, you can use your reaction to unleash a powerful warcry before the casting is finished. All friendly creatures within 30 feet of you gain advantage on their next saving throw against spells, or until 1 minute has passed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, all enemies within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier, taking 1d6 + your barbarian level in psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After a failed save, a target is also deafened until the start of your next turn.</p>

			<p>Starting at 14th level, you become able to overpower magic through pure might. While raging, after you hit a creature or object with a melee weapon attack, you can decide to cleave all magic from it. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, you make a Strength Check against a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alternatively, you can decide to make a melee attack against any lingering magical effect directly, provided you can reach it; such as Flaming Sphere, Cloudkill, or even Wall of Force. This attack lands automatically, but the same rules apply to dispel the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can only use this feature once per turn.</p>
